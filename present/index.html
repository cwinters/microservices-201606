  <h1>Microservices: moving parts around</h1>
  <h3>Chris Winters <br /> @cwinters <br /> Turnitin</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What are we doing here?</h2>
  <p>Talk about moving parts behind microservices</p>
  <p>Why are we using microservices, and what are our plans?</p>
  <p>How do they help and hinder?</p>
  <aside class="notes">
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Initial questions</h2>
  <p>Back-end vs front-end</p>
  <p class="fragment">Docker</p>
  <p class="fragment">Microservices</p>
  <p class="fragment">AWS/Azure/Google/...</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Back-end focused, not going to dig into front-end stuff in any
    of this (build, deploy, etc)<br />
    - How many people have used Docker? In production? <br />
    - How many people are using microservices? Planning to? <br />
    - How many people have used a cloud provider? Planning to?
   </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Where we started: Revision Assistant</h2>
  <p>Use machine learning to help students write better</p>
  <p>Focus on drafting process rather than scoring standards</p>
  <p>Acquired by Turnitin in October 2014</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    - provide feedback (comments and scoring) to students during the drafting process <br />
  </aside>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Where we started: architecture</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Single app taking all requests; one per EC2 <br />
    - Single worker taking all async jobs; one per EC2 <br />
    - Deployment via Ansible
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Where we are now: architecture</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Move app and worker into Docker containers, still serve a lot of traffic<br />
    - Created separate part of the app, served by microservices and their own tables<br />
    - Right now re-architecting the workers to scale
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Where we want to be: architecture</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Pulling more pieces of the single app out into services <br />
    - Merge duplicate data (users, groups, assignments) <br />
    - Autoscaling at microservice level
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why not?</h2>
  <p>Operating a single app is way easier</p>
  <p>Easier to propagate patterns within single codebase</p>
  <p>Everything is in one place, both code and things like admin tools (Django)</p>
  <aside class="notes">
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why not?</h2>
  <p>Reaching into another table for a join, or a single piece of data, is easy</p>
  <p>No network call boundaries (latency)</p>
  <aside class="notes">
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Independence (concurrent projects)</p>
  <p class="fragment">Keep a thing in your head</p>
  <p class="fragment">...both of which help with speed</p>
  <p class="fragment">Disentangle via forced separation</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Dan North presentation on keeping it in your head <br />
    - Speed is the need <br />
    - Constraint of separate processes helps ensure you don't create the God
    Class or the Ubiquitous User Model
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Make side-effects explicit</p>
  <p class="fragment">Small vectors for experimenting</p>
  <p class="fragment">Scale at more granular level</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Create subrant about side-effects? <br />
    - Experiment with framework, language, database, design patterns... <br />
    - It's easier (less expensive) to scale a service with a 64 MB footprint
    than a larger server with a 256 MB footprint
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why? (Conway's Law)</h2>
  <p>...doesn't really apply to us, yet</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    - Turnitin Pittsburgh is still pretty small <br />
    - Sidenote, don't think that a team-per-service is some golden rule you
    have to follow.
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>But... I can do that now</h2>
  <p>Are microservices the only way to do these? NO</p>
  <p class="fragment">...but few teams exhibit discipline to do them in monolith</p>
  <aside class="notes">
  </aside>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Guardrails not recipes</h2>
  <p>Provide 
    - Provide constraints in areas where you know your team (or teams in
      general) are prone to get things wrong...
    - ...and provide freedom to experiment with new things

  <p>Example: testing</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP: something that (a) answers HTTP (b) with a data format (JSON) as
        (c) structured as JSON API so that (d) a particular library can handle
        generically -- at what point does that change from constraints to control?</li>
      <li>Logging: should you say how logging happens, or should you define the
        set of data you need to include because of the surrounding
        infrastructure and let code decide how it wants to do that?</li>
      <li>Migrations: The actual need: every time this service starts it should
        ensure it's running against the right schema</li>
      <li>Layout: Docker and config as ENV vs "implement a main method that
        takes args x, y, and z and references properties file located
        in /etc/myapp.properties"</li>
      <li>Testing: Execute some command; if it exits with 0 tests pass;

  <h2>Guardrails, not blinders</h2>

  - Constraints in areas where you know your team (or teams in general) are
  prone to get things wrong. Are microservices the only way to get isolation,
  bounded contexts, independent deployability, no side-effects, etc. Nope. But
  many (all?) of the other ways require a discipline I've seen few teams exhibit.

<!--
Control:

- Illusory if you're not doing it at the right level. Worst kind is when
you *think* you have control but you don't actually.

Data

- Constraint: Bezos telling Amazon that services must not access other
services' data directly. (Yegge post) This frees up the service to
use whatever datastore it wants - NoSQL, key/value, relational, filesystem.

- Control: You must use version x of database y. All tables must be fully
normalized and all references must be backed by foreign keys.

More

Useful constraints for accessing data

- Gets you away from integrating at the data level (...because your data live
  forever, and if everyone can reach in and muck with tables controls your
  ability to change by increasing the cost due to unforeseen side-effects)

- Naturally restrict the way your data are accessed - arbitrary queries can
  kill your DB (yes, even your NoSQL DB), and wrapping an API around it goes a
  long way to ensuring that doesn't happen. Because your API will tend toward
  smaller since maintaining a large API is so painful. (But you'll probably do
  it anyway.)

- Restricting the access to data also has side-effect of lowering the amount
  you have to keep in your head (easier maintenance).


Ideas:

- Our system: everything is relational.
- We are using a single database... right now.
- Services cannot peek into other services tables...
- ...except for reporting (still thinking about this)
- Also: data affinity for read-only.
