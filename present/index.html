  <h2>Constrain data access</h2>
  <p>Get away from integrating at data level - they live forever</p>
  <p>Wrapping API around queries means you can control arbitrary access</p>

  <h2>Few data lessons</h2>
  <p>Everything is relational (except caches)</p>
  <p>...with some JSONB tables</p>
  <p class="fragment">We are using a single database... for now</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    Seams of services and their data inform how we can scale out the database

  <h2>Few data lessons</h2>
  <p>Services cannot peek into other services tables...</p>
  <p>...except for reporting (still thinking about this)</p>
  <p class="fragment">Data affinity for read-only.</p>

  <h2>Emergent simplicity</h2>
  <p>"You get these emergent simplicities when the thing starts to take shape..." (Dan North)</p>

  <h2>Left to do</h2>
  <p>Client per backend service</p>
  <p>Testing service-to-service interactions</p>
  <p>Monitoring improvements</p>
  <p>Move to AWS blessed architecture?</p>
